# Pedigree Project

## This project will generate a pedigree chart for one of five inheritance types as specified by the user. These five inheritance types are: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, X-linked recessive, and Y-linked. The user may also specify how many generations they would like the pedigree chart to complete, with a minimum limit set to three, counting the first generation (parents), and a maximum limit set to 10 (lest it become unwieldy). The genotypes of the first two individuals (the parents) will be selected by the user. The user can choose if the trait is autosomal or sex-linked and if the trait is dominant or recessive. Each generation must have at least one child until the specified number of generations is reached. Each generation will have a number listed next to it for reference. Every individual has a 75% chance of marrying and having children of their own. The user may specify whether they would like all individuals who marry into the family to either not have the trait or to have a random genotype for that trait. Every individual may have anywhere from 0-5 children and every individual has a certain chance of having the trait expressed and passed down based on the type of inheritance of that trait. The user may save an image of this pre-filled pedigree chart to their device.
